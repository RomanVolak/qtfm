#####################
Build
#####################

To build qtFM from source run the following in this directory:
 
>qmake		(or maybe 'qmake-qt4' depending on your distro)
>make



#####################
Install
#####################

If you install qtFM through your distro as a package then everything should be taken care of already.

If you build qtFM from source you can simply run the binary from the build directory, or to install it manually
you should do the following (as root):

	- copy qtfm binary to '/usr/bin'
	- copy 'qtfm.desktop' to '/usr/share/applications'
	- copy './images/qtfm.png' to '/usr/share/pixmaps'
 


#####################
Run
#####################

Command Line Parameters:

 $folder	startup folder		- qtFM will start in this folder. Starts in $HOME by default.  
 -d		daemon mode		- starts qtfm and remains running in the background.

				  
Try adding:
 
 sleep 4s && qtfm -d &

to your '.xinitrc' file to start automatically at login.



#####################
Single-Click Navigation
#####################

Single-click navigation can be enabled by adding a key called 'singleClick' to the general section of the qtfm.conf 
configuration file located in '~/.config/qtfm'.

There are two modes you can enable:

 singleClick=1		single click activation of directories only
 singleClick=2		everything is single click



#####################
Custom Actions
#####################

Filetype:

 Options for the filetype are:

 $suffix	-	matches files of that type.  Multiple suffix can be separated by commas. eg 'png,jpg'.
 $folder	-	$folder is a specific folder name. Matches only that folder. eg 'Trash'
 $parent 	-	$parent is the full path to a folder. Matches all folders below this one. eg. '/media'	
 folder		-	matches all folders.
 *		-	matches everything, all files and folders.


Text:

 This is the text that will appear in the menu for your custom action.  It can be any descriptive text you like.

 There is one special case:- if you set the text to 'Open' it will override the default xdg-open association for that
 filetype.  This custom action will then be used as the default for 'double-click' and 'right-click->open' commands.

 You can group custom actions together by using a ' / ' in the text.  Items with the same prefix will be grouped in
 a submenu.

 eg. for images;

	jpg,png		Open with / gqview
	jpg,png		Open with / gimp
	

Icon:

 The name of any icon from your current theme.  Double-click the entry to bring up the icon chooser dialog.


Command:

 This is the custom command you want to run.  You can also call any external shell script from the custom action.
 Use an external shell script if you want to perform complicated actions that require more than a single line command.

 The parameter substitutions that can be passed to the command are:

 %f	-	selected filenames
 %F	-	selected filenames with full path
 %n	-	current filename (ie. the file you right-clicked on)

 []	-	tick the checkbox to monitor the output of the command. qtFM will be notified and report stdout and stderr
		messages after the command has completed.


Examples of some useful custom actions:
